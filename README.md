# XGBoost

This repository provides resources and code for training XGBoost models. The focus is on practical implementations, model evaluations, and the integration of various techniques to enhance model performance.

## Features

- **XGBoost Overview**: An overview on XGBoost.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilities for preparing data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Techniques to build a great XGboost model.
- **Encoding Discussion**: A discussion on whether to use Ordinal Encoding or One-Hot Encoding when training an XGBoost model.

## Notebooks
- xgboost_gridsearch_cv: An exercise using adult data where I implement Machine Learning techniques to build XGboost models and discuss encoding techniques.
