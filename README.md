# XGBoost

This repository provides resources and code for training deep neural networks using Keras and TensorFlow. The focus is on practical implementations, model evaluations, and the integration of various techniques to enhance model performance.

## Features

- **XGBoost Overview**: An overview on XGBoost.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilities for preparing data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Techniques to build a great XGboost model.
- **Encoding Discussion**: A discussion on whether to use Ordinal Encoding or One-Hot Encoding when training an XGBoost model.

## Notebooks
- xgboost_exercise: An exercise using adult data where I implement Machine Learning techniques to build XGboost models and discuss encoding techniques.
